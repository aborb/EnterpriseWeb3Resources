      Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a superior mechanism to represent and transact digital value. 
      DLT may provide ‘always on’, resilient, global, programmable, multi-asset financial networks....

    <p>The ideas around CBDC design and architecture have developed rapidly over the past 2 years. 
      The typical CBDC project is initiated by one or several central banks as they work their way through 
      the design choices. One tool in this journey has been the R3 Sandbox for Digital Currencies, 
      which allows participants to experience the outcomes of different design choices....

    <p>A vision for a CBDC is to provision a public payment infrastructure for central bank money which would provide a universal 
      settlement mechanism in a future of rapidly evolving digital ecosystems. Such a CBDC might encourage innovation by allowing a wide 
      and varied range of private sector firms to develop more advanced services, in a safe and interoperable manner that fosters 
      advantageous competition...

    </a>
    <p>The widespread introduction of central bank digital currency is becoming ever more realistic. At present, over 60% of global 
      central banks are experimenting with technology for digital currencies.1 With the European Central Bank announcing the launch of a 
      digital euro project in mid-July,2 the central bank digital currency vision is rapidly transitioning to reality. Now, it’s no longer 
      a question of whether central bank digital currency is at all possible, but rather just how central banks go about defining the 
      design of a CBDC...

    <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/decentralizing-your-website-f5bca765f9ed">Decentralizing your website using IPFS + ENS</a>
    <p>When hosting a website usually you use a dedicated VPS like Digital Ocean, Linode, Google, or Amazon. After setting up your server you can register a domain at Google Domains or NameCheap. The last step is editing your DNS records to point your domain at your server. Now you can access your website by navigating to your domain name. However, there is a problem with this. Your VPS controls the hosting of your site and the domain name service you went with maintains control of your domain. What happens if your VPS goes down or the company you are using is suddenly blacklisted in your country?
